--Time series means analyzing data that is trended over time.

--One common way of analyzing time series is comparing data between periods.

--For example, day-over-day or month-over-month change.

--The LAG() function in SQL is a window function that allows you to do this.

--Using the LAG() function, you can calculate period-to-period changes, such as the difference in sales between consecutive months or the growth in user signups from week to week.

--Let's consider an example where we have a table named monthly_sales with the following data (image below).

--In this example, the LAG() function is used within the OVER() clause, which defines the order of rows to be used in the calculation.

--The LAG(sales) function retrieves the sales value from the previous row, relative to the current row, when sorted by the month column.

--That gives us the previous month's sales right next to the current month in the column to the right.

--Then in the last column, we subtract the previous month's sales from the current month's sales to get the sales change.

SELECT 
	month, 
	sales,
	LAG(sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_sals
	sales - LAG(sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS sales_change
FROM monthly_sales
